What the parser understands

(If you don’t follow this, it falls back to defaults.)

1. Sites

Use a number + the word “site(s)”
Examples:

“2 sites”

“4 industrial sites”

“3 factories”

2. Sensors

Two formats it truly understands:

a) X sensors per site → preferred

“15 sensors per site”

“20 sensors per site”

b) X sensors → fallback

“30 sensors”

3. Edges

Two ways:

“3 edge nodes”

“3 edges”

If you don’t specify, parser auto-sets edges = sites

4. Link quality

Should include one of:

“weak inter-site link / WAN link”

“normal inter-site link”

“strong inter-site link”

5. Protocol

Should mention:

mqtt

coap

tcp

udp

publish-subscribe

6. Objective

Use one of:

reliability

resilient / robustness

low latency / fast response

bandwidth / efficient

7. Duration

Use:

“for X minutes”

“for X seconds”

“run 60s”

“run 5 minutes”

The Golden Template

Use something like this structure:

“Deploy X sites with Y sensors per site, use ______ protocol, assume ______ inter-site links, prioritize ______, and run for ______.”

This hits all the fields the parser can extract.

10 GOOD SAMPLE PROMPTS

These all follow the rules and will trigger different outputs.

1. Reliability-focused, weak links

“Deploy 3 sites with 12 sensors per site, assume weak inter-site links, use MQTT publish–subscribe, and prioritize reliability for 5 minutes.”

2. Latency-focused, strong links

“Set up 2 industrial sites with 20 sensors per site, use TCP-style communication, assume strong inter-site WAN, and optimize for low latency during a 90-second run.”

3. Heavy-load scenario

“Create 4 sites with 30 sensors per site, use UDP-based transmission, keep links at normal quality, and run a 3-minute low-latency experiment.”

4. Minimal deployment

“Deploy 1 site with 10 sensors, assume normal links, use MQTT, and aim for balanced performance over 60 seconds.”

5. High bandwidth emphasis

“Build 2 smart-factory sites with 25 sensors per site, use CoAP, strong inter-site connectivity, and optimize for bandwidth-efficient operation for 4 minutes.”

6. High resilience stress test

“Configure 5 sites with 8 sensors per site, weak WAN connections, use MQTT, and maximize resilience for 2 minutes.”

7. Dynamic multi-edge

“Set up 3 sites with 18 sensors per site, define 3 edge nodes, use TCP, weak links, and focus on reliable data delivery for 120 seconds.”

8. Massive sensor network

“Deploy 2 locations with 50 sensors per site, strong links, UDP streaming, and optimize for low latency for a 1-minute experiment.”

9. Mixed objective

“Create 4 IoT sites hosting 10 sensors per site, normal WAN links, use MQTT, and balance latency and reliability for 5 minutes.”

10. Bandwidth-pressure scenario

“Deploy 3 sites with 40 sensors per site, weak connectivity, publish–subscribe messaging, and prioritize throughput for 3 minutes.”

Summary: How to write prompts

If you want the system to react differently, include:

a number of sites

sensors per site

optional edge count

link quality

protocol

objective

duration

If any of these are missing, parser uses defaults → looks same → frustration → panic → drama.

Now you have a clear map of what the machine expects. You can craft “grown-up” network scenarios that will visually and numerically change the topology and metrics.

If you want, I can generate 50 more prompts, or tailor them specifically for interview demo.
